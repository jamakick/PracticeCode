However, he slowed down over the past two weeks with 76 total rushing yards on 22 carries, both Raiders losses.</p><div class="ad"><div class="lazy br-ad-wrapper atom advert"><div id="br-ad-101785072" class="br-ad-lazy" data-collapsed="1" data-position="rect_atf_01" data-reload="1" data-responsive-size="[[[1270,0],[[970,250],[970,66],[300,250]]],[[728,0],[[728,90],[300,250]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[320,50]]]]" data-size="[[300,600],[300,250],[300,2]]"></div></div></div><p>For the season, Lynch has 376 rushing yards and three touchdowns, plus 84 receiving yards. Meanwhile, the Raiders are just 1-5 and look like they will compete for the No. 1 overall draft pick.</p><p>Veteran <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/doug-martin">Doug Martin</a> will likely handle much of the early-down work in the backfield, while Jalen Richard will try to become a bigger factor after being used mostly as a receiver to start the season.</p><p>Lynch spent a year in retirement before coming back to join the Raiders last season. He totaled 891 yards and seven touchdowns for his hometown team, starting all 15 games he played.</p><p>He might not want to return to the Raiders next year, and the pending free agent likely won't find too much of a market with his age and the mileage on his body.</p><p>If he doesn't return this year, it could be the end of the line for the five-time Pro Bowler.</p></div></div><footer><div
