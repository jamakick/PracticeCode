We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16. Our Services are not intended for children under the age of 16, and children under the age of 16 should not use or register for our Services. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected any information from your child, please email us at <a href="mailto:euprivacy@meredith.com">euprivacy@meredith.com</a>.

The information we collect includes personal data, which is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Third-party providers and advertisers featured on, or linked to or from, our Services may also gather information, including personal data, through processes that we don&#39;t control and subject to their own separate privacy policies, which may differ from ours. Some of our Services also participate in third-party advertising networks or similar services that collect information about your computer or device and your activity online and as a mobile user to tailor some of the advertising that you see on our Services and other third-party sites, mobile apps and marketing channels in their networks to your interests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Personal Data You Provide to Us.</h3><p>You will need to register to use certain features of our Services. When you register, we collect personal data, including your first and last name, postal address, email address, user name and password, reminder questions and answers and communications preferences, such as which newsletters you would like to receive. We also ask for information about your age, gender, hobbies, interests, preferences (such as your favorite foods, purchases or recipes) and the like, but you&#39;re free to register for most of our Services without providing this additional information.</p><p>If you make a purchase (such as when you order magazines or other products), we collect information necessary to process your payment, including your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number), and the security code associated with your payment instrument.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Newsletters and Subscriptions.</h3><p>You may sign up for certain newsletters and subscriptions without registering an account. When you sign up, we collect personal data, including your first and last name and email address.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Contests and Other Promotions.</h3><p>From time to time, we offer surveys, contests, sweepstakes or other promotions. Participation in these promotions may require registration for our Services (see &quot;Personal Data You Provide to Us,&quot; above). If you choose to participate in promotions, we will collect contact information such as your name, address, and email address as well as other information in connection with your registration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Communications.</h3><p>We collect the content of messages you send to us, including feedback and product reviews you write, questions and information you provide to customer support, and when you report a problem with our Services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Job Applications.</h3><p>If you submit an application to us, we collect data as necessary to consider you for a job opening, including your employment history, transcript, writing samples, and references.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Information Collected Automatically When You Use Our Services.</h3><p>Meredith or third-party contractors we engage collect certain information, including personal data, automatically when you use our Services, including but not limited to:</p><ul><li>Web pages, content and advertisements you view and links you click on while navigating within our Services;</li><li>Information about your interactions with our content, including video or audio content, such as the type of content accessed via our Services;</li><li>Information about your interactions with our email messages, such as the links you click on and whether you open or forward a message, the date and time of these interactions and the device you use to read emails;</li><li>The site you visited before visiting a Meredith website and the site you visited after visiting a Meredith website;</li><li>Your Internet Protocol (IP) address (a numerical address assigned to your device by your Internet service provider so that other devices connected to the Internet can communicate with you online) that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area;</li><li>Search terms you enter using our Services or on a referral site;</li><li>Unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers, that can identify the physical location of devices in accordance with applicable law;</li><li>Your device type, screen size, browser type, language and other settings, memory capacity, plug-ins, Internet domain, TCP configuration parameters, operating system, carrier code, time zone and the names, versions and package IDs of software installed on your device;</li><li>Standard server log information; and</li><li>Information collected through cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies (see additional descriptions of these terms below).</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Personalization and Tracking Technologies.</h3><p>Like most website and mobile application operators, we, our service providers or other third parties acting on our behalf or with our permission, use embedded scripts, &quot;cookies,&quot; web beacons, device identifiers and other tracking technologies to operate, analyze, improve and protect the security of our Services and tailor content and advertising to user interests. Third-party companies that provide some of the tools and features accessible through our Services and advertisers and other companies involved in the delivery of advertisements you see on our Services and other websites also may use tracking technologies to collect information about your use of our Services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Cookies.</h3><p>Cookies are small amounts of data (often containing a unique identifier) that are stored in separate files within your computer or device&#39;s Internet browser. Cookies are accessed and recorded by the websites you visit, and by the companies that deliver the advertisements you see on our services, so they can recognize the same browser navigating online. You can set your browser to accept or reject most cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the &quot;Help&quot; menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) It is up to you to decide whether to allow us or third parties to set cookies, but if you block cookies, you may not be able to view or access some of the features of our Services. Please be aware that certain browsers cannot block or delete so-called &quot;Flash&quot; cookies, which use a feature of the Adobe Flash video player to store information on your computer. For information about how to delete Flash cookies, please visit the Adobe website <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">here</a>. To learn more about how we use cookies on our Services based in the EU, please visit the Cookie Policy linked from the EU-based Service you are using.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technologies.</h3><p>Web beacons (sometimes called &quot;transparent GIFs,&quot; &quot;clear GIFs,&quot; or &quot;pixel tags&quot;) are small strings of code that embed a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email or advertisement. When your browser downloads a web beacon, the server that sends the corresponding image to your browser can recognize and store certain types of information such as cookies previously set, the time and date that you viewed the page embedded with the beacon and a description of that page.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Mobile Device IDs and Location-Based Information.</h3><p>Certain mobile devices, including smart phones and tablet devices, contain unique device IDs that can be used to identify their physical location. Some mobile device IDs are persistent, while others may be resettable by accessing the device&#39;s privacy settings. Mobile devices also typically transmit caller ID data (which may include a phone number) when used to transmit a telephone call or text message. When you use mobile devices to access our Services, we may collect and transmit unique device IDs and collect caller ID data, as well as other information about your device, including without limitation, your wireless carrier, the make, model, operating system, capacity and settings of your device, the names, package IDs and versions of other software you have downloaded to your device and information about how you interact with and navigate within our Service. With your consent, we or our authorized service providers and partners also may use precise geolocation technology such as GPS or Wi-Fi triangulation or mobile Bluetooth beacon technology to collect information about the exact location of your mobile device. Precise location information may be collected both while you are using one of our mobile applications and continuously over time while our apps are not in use but are running in the background of your device. This information may be used for the purposes described below in <a href="http://www.meredith.com/legal/privacy#header-usage">&quot;How We Use The Information We Collect,&quot;</a> including to tailor special offers and advertising to your interests, both in our Services, and in third-party marketing channels. You can withdraw your consent to the further collection and use of your precise device location data through any of our mobile apps by accessing your device&#39;s privacy settings as further explained below in <a href="http://www.meredith.com/legal/privacy#preciselocationoptout">&quot;Opt-out Choices: Precise Device Location Tracking.&quot;</a> For information about how to reset your advertising identifier and your other opt-out choices relating to interest-based advertising in mobile applications, see <a href="http://www.meredith.com/legal/privacy#mobileAppAd">&quot;Opt-out Choices: Mobile App Advertising and Tracking.&quot;</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Social Network Posting Tools and &quot;Share&quot; Features.</h3><p>You can access various social network posting and sharing tools through our Services that are operated by third parties, including a &quot;share&quot; button that allows you to post links to content and features that you believe will be of interest to others on your social network pages. When you visit a page that includes one of these sharing tools, the third-party company that operates the tool may be collecting information about your browser, device and online activity through its own tracking technologies and subject to its own separate privacy policy, which may differ from ours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Nielsen Online Campaign Ratings Service.</h3><p>Some of our advertisers participate in a program operated by the Nielsen Company to develop an Online Campaign Ratings service that is comparable to Nielsen&#39;s television ratings. When one of their ads appears on our Services, it may contain a web beacon that will record your exposure to the ad, read certain cookies on your browser, and forward this information to one or more operators of third-party websites or other online service on which you may have registered. If the third-party operator recognizes a cookie that identifies you as one of its registered users, it will append the impression data it receives, which may identify you as a user our Services, with age and gender information before returning the data to Nielsen. Nielsen aggregates the data it receives about a given campaign to create ratings reports for advertisers and publishers. According to Nielsen, these reports measure campaign performance on an aggregate level within various demographic categories and do not identify you personally. For more information about Nielsen&#39;s information collection practices and any related opt-out choices, please see the Nielsen.com privacy policy <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/privacy-policy.html">here</a>.</p><p class="top"><a href="#privacyPolicy">Return to top</a></p><p class="top">&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" id="header-information">Information We Obtain From Other Sources:</h3><p>We combine information collected through the Services with other information that we obtain about you, your computer, and/or device from other companies and sources.

The following describes some of the circumstances in which we share information about our users:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Email.</h3><p>If we have consent if and to the extent required by law, we share our users&#39; email addresses with service providers that send email messages and deliver targeted advertising on our behalf. These service providers collect data about how you interact with those messages (including information about whether and when you opened a particular message or clicked on a link within a message and the device you used to do so) and analyze it in conjunction with similar information they collect when you respond to emails they send on behalf of their other clients who are not affiliated with us. They use this email response information in combination with your email address to target and optimize the delivery of emails and email advertising they send on our behalf and for their other clients. We may also provide our service providers with lists of our user email addresses in a hashed or otherwise encrypted form that they use to recognize our users as they navigate online or use third-party email services and enable the delivery of interest-based advertising to those users. We prohibit our service providers from sharing your email address with their other clients.</p><p>If you use our Services to sign up for special email offers from third-party advertisers, we will also share your email address and any other information you provided with your request with the advertisers you selected. Except as described in this policy, we will not sell or rent your email address to unaffiliated third parties for their email marketing purposes, without your consent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Co-Registration Offers.</h3><p>If, during or immediately following registration, you choose to access offers for goods or services that are available from selected third-party companies (&quot;Co-Registration Vendors&quot;), we may make certain contact and demographic information you provide (e.g., name, age, and/or email address) available to these vendors with your consent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Provider Partners and Affiliates.</h3><p>To make your experience with our Services more useful and enjoyable, we may offer some features (such as social sharing tools and chat rooms) in conjunction with third-party providers and affiliates (&quot;Provider Partners&quot;) that specialize in operating such services. We share with each of these Provider Partners such information as is necessary to provide you with the services we offer through that Provider Partner. Some of our Provider Partners may collect information directly from you, including personal data, pursuant to their own separate privacy policies which may differ from ours. For example, our affiliated company Meredith Performance Marketing, LLC operates the home contractor referral tools available through some of our sites and collects information through such features pursuant to its separate privacy policy available <a href="http://www.bhg.com/home-services/privacy_policy">here</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Service Providers.</h3><p>We also contract with other companies to provide specialized services to us, including but not limited to credit-card and billing processing, shipping, marketing, advertising optimization and interest-based targeting, email and text message distribution, data processing, mobile and website analytics, user authentication, security and promotions management. We reserve the right to share with these companies any information we collect about you, including personal data, and/or authorize them to collect information from you directly to support the services they provide to us. For example, some of our Services integrate with Google&#39;s reCAPTCHA widget to help us distinguish authentic human users from &quot;bots&quot; and protect our sites from spam and abuse. Through cookies and other tracking technologies, Google collects information about user activity to provide us with this service and processes and stores such information pursuant to its privacy policy available <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">here</a>.

We don&#39;t control these third parties&#39; privacy practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their collection and use of your information. We also share some of your entry information with third parties or the public in connection with the administration of the promotion, such as winner selection and prize fulfillment, and as permitted by the promotion&#39;s official rules, such as on a winners&#39; list.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Legal Compliance, Security and Compelled Disclosures.</h3><p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated herein or within our Services, we occasionally release information about users of our Services when we deem such release appropriate to comply with law, respond to compulsory process or law enforcement requests, enforce our <a href="http://www.meredith.com/legal/terms">Terms of Service Agreement</a>, or protect the rights, property or safety of users of our Services, the public, Meredith Corporation, our affiliates, or any third party.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Business Transfers.</h3><p>Over time, we may reorganize or transfer various assets and lines of business.

We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="subheading" style="font-size:18px">Aggregated Information and Information that Does Not Identify You.</h3><p>We and our service providers may combine information about you with information that we or they collect about other users of our Services and share it in a form that does not identify you personally.
