<h2>Jacob Kickbush</h2>

<p>My name is Jacob Kickbush, I usually go by Jake, and I am currently a senior majoring in Informatics with a minor in Game Design at Indiana University.</p>

<p>
I was born and raised in northern Indiana, in a small town called Walkerton. I went to John Glenn High School and graduated in 2015.

<div class="contentText">

<p>I am a programmer, interested in working on video games or any related media. I enjoy learning new languages and concepts in programming that I then use to further my own standards and style. I am very familiar with Python, Java, Javascript, and C#.</p>

</div>

<div class="contentText">

<p>My personal interests are in theatre productions, I enjoy performing and seeing musicals and plays, whether it is professional or community performed. I am also an avid video game player, I enjoy most games other than the new trend of Battle Royale, Racing games, and Sports games. I play just about anything other than those. I would like to work on video games as seeing your code come to life is the best part of programming, and this is especially true when it comes to games.</p>
